# The Theater
This project takes the [Code.org](https://code.org) Theatre
and breaks it free of the Java Lab so that you can use it in
BlueJ.

## Where can I get documentation for the Theater?
[Code.org](https://code.org) provides some wonderful 
[documentation](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Theater)
for use with Java Lab, the same should cover this version.
